# Welcome to my Data Science Github. 

The projects I've uploaded showcase my skills according to Philip Guo's data science workflow, where I follow the process of acquiring data, asking an interesting question, data inspection, data cleaning, data exploration, analysis and reflection. The majority of my projects focus on natural language processing, topic modeling, and text analysis while I also include implementations of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, evaluations of model performance and my rationale for why I chose the parameters I did. I hope you enjoy my work!
