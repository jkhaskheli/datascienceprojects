# Welcome to my Data Science Github. 

The projects I've uploaded showcase my skills with regards to Philip Guo's data science workflow, where I follow the process of acquiring data, asking an interesting question, data inspection, data cleaning, data exploration, analysis and reflection. I hope you enjoy my work!
