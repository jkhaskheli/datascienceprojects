Or was the sentiment of this tweets more or less at the same level throughout hsi presidency? Does he tweet about a certain social or political issue often or just certain ones?\n",

My hope is that exploring this question would give more insight into what topics/words Trump tweeted about that increased his engagement."

These tweets are taken from rows 1000 to 1010 but there are at least 100 more rows of tweets that start with 'RT'.

    "In my opinion, the WhitespaceTokenizer works the best for my data because it doesn't separately tokenize the apostrophies that occur from having my data in a list. The data must be in list form to pass through the different tokenizer functions and because of this, the TweetTokenizer and word_tokenize Tokenizer captured the apostrophies and brackets while the Whitespace Tokenizer noticed the space between two tweets.The TweetTokenizer would work best to use on tweets if there were a lot of exclamation or question marks and we wanted to capture those to analyze for sentiment, however in this case, since all punctuation marks were removed from the data, I can see that the Whitespace Tokenizer tokenizes the words best by considering the whitespace and separating the tweets once with the apostrophies and doesn't dedicate a row for every single punctuation mark like the others do. This separation can be seen in row 2."

    "- To perform sentiment analysis with Vader, I plan to loop through the entire cleaned dataset (clean_tt) and calculate the polarity score. I will then set thresholds for what should be scored as positive, negative and neutral. These thresholds are as follows: any thing with a score of 0.5 or larger will be marked as 'positive' and appended to an array, anything less than a score of 0 will be marked as 'negative' and everything else will be marked as neutral.\n",
    "- I will created two empty arrays, one will be so tthat I can append the numerical scores and one so that I can append a written score of either 'Positive Sentiment', 'Negative Sentiment' or 'Neutral Sentiment'."

    "- For my 3 methods for sentiment analysis, I used Vader, TextBlob and Empath. I noticed that Vader took a significantly longer time to run than TextBlob and Empath but Empath was following closely behind Vader for long runtimes. I also noticed from visual inspection of the dataframe containing sentiment scores from Vader, that the compound scores took on a wider range of values than the values that the polarity scores took on for TextBlob. From visual inspection of some of the polarity scores, I found that TextBlob usually scored tweets as neutral with a score of '0'. \n",
    "- Additionally, I only included polarity scores when I used TextBlob and disregarded subjectivity because I only wanted to focus on comparing polarity and sentiment scores between TextBlob and Vader. However, comparing how the subjectivity and polarity varied amongst tweets might be something I would change if I were to do this again to better understand why more tweets were scored as neutral using TextBlob.\n",
    "- My third method for sentiment analysis was Empath. My approach was to loop through the cleaned tweets dataframe, collect all of the categories that Empath pulls out from these tweets, and then pass this list of categories through a function that calculates the most common words from this list. Empath took a while to finish running the code because it was pulling out a list of categories for each tweet. I then pulled out the top 10 most common words form this list of categories, where I found that amongst this collection, categories like 'government', 'leader', 'positive_emotion' and 'negative_emotion' were amongst the most commonly mentioned categories. It was a coincidence that 'positive_emotion' and 'negative_emotion' were in the top 10 categories mentioned because I was able to compare the counts with the other two methods I used for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- In addition, I'm not sure exactly what occurred during my cleaning process or the sentiment analysis, but my dataframe contained at least 400 rows of empty strings, so I converted those rows to NaN and dropped them from both the Vader and TextBlob dataframes containing the sentiment scores and I still ended up having the same number of rows in both dataframes."

The value would be false if the sentiments compared in the Vader and TextBlob dataframes did not match and it would be True if they did match. Then I could use value.counts( ) to see how many tweets in both methods were classified with the same sentiment and how many differed. I wasn't able to do this method because I kept running into errors with the dataframe formatting.\n",

This method does not show me the specific tweets and how each one was classified depending on the method, but I can see which method classified more tweets with a positive sentiment score rather than a negative one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I found that the Vader sentiment method classified more tweets with a positive sentiment score than either Empath and TextBlob did. TextBlob classified the most number of tweets as Neutral with a value of 10046. Vader also classified more tweets as Negative than TextBlob did. \n",

I'm not including Empath officially because I pulled out the most common categories and positive and negative emotion *happened* to be the top 10 common categories, which no neutral category included. The difference between Vader and TextBlob was 2911 for scoring positive sentiment, with Vader scoring more positive sentiment. The difference was 4786 for scoring neutral sentiment with TextBlob scoring more tweets as neutral. This makes me think that TextBlob has a higher threshold for scoring tweets as positive or Vader has a lower threshold for scoring tweets as positive since there was a much larger number of tweets scored as neutral for TextBlob. And the difference was 1136 for tweets scored as negative.\n"

    "- I hand coded most of the tweets from the random sample as negative or neutral, with 7 being neutral, 11 being negative and 6 being positive. From visual inspection, the TextBlob method worked the best because it didn't classify any of the tweets as positive, only neutral and negative sentiment.\n",

    "- From the Vader Sentiment time series plot, although it's very crowded and I wasn't able to condense or limit the amount of data I was plotting, I can still see that there are more negative tweets towards the end of Trump's time on Twitter than there was in the beginning. I draw this inference because the concentration of negative sentiment scores fills the area at the bottom of the plot more in the '2020' year range on the x-axis than there is in the '2018' year range. I infer that the increased number of negative tweets came from the pandemic happening and Trump tweeting more about fake news and the pandemic being less of a big deal than it actually was. As his presidency continued through time, more negative events occurred that I'm hypothesizing caused him to tweet more negative tweets compared to what he tweeted when he first came into office.\n",
    "- In the TextBlob Sentiment time series plot, I observe the same pattern as I did in the Vader Sentiment plot. The prevalence of negative tweets grows from 2018 to 2020, with there being a larger concentration of negative tweets in the 2020 year range. The TextBlob method scores more tweets as neutral than Vader, so that's why the points are concentrated more in the middle of the plot at 0."
